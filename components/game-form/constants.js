You wake up in the middle of a spooky town trying to find your way back home. Help the citizens of this weird town and they will open paths for you.
BUT BEWARE!  

The streets are swarming with spirits and if you let them, they will take you away. Shoot them down with your mysterious powers and win candy in return. 

Spend your candy on vending machines across the town, and grow in power. Make sure to find them all as the night progresses, the spirits become spookier.

The Lost Night is a game made in PICO-8 by Mario Carballo and Joven Paul. It's our first attempt at an RPG and we enjoyed the process. Sadly we hit all the limits within PICO-8, so more content or improvements are would be too hard to implement.  
We appreciate your feedback.  
-Thanks for playing
Extras!!
